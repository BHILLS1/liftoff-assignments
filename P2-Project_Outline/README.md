## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I have spent the last three years building a brand centered around yoga and wellness under my name, Brittany L Hill and the event experience I created, Back Trap Yoga. The app that I'm creating will be along the lines of a Wikipedia for yoga, a means to search and find yoga poses that will include yoga pose breakdown videos. I did some basic user research with my audience to gauge what things they were looking to see from me to fulfill their needs around yoga and wellness. Yoga pose videos were highly requested. This app will provide a platform that allow users to connect further by being able to experience my alignment cues anywhere they can connect to the app. The app will include yoga pose videos and gives students the opportunity to "take me anywhere" and get the key cueing they would receive if they were in person in class. The app allows them to maintain consistency in their practice while being able to explore poses at their own pace in the comfort of their own space.
### Features
User login: Users are able to log in and create an account. Each user will have a profile page.
Search: Users will be able to search for through videos to find given text that describes specific pose or type of flow (i.e. "Downward Dog").
### Technologies
Java
JavaScript
SpringBoot
Stripe Payment
MySQL
SQLAlchemy
### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn JavaScript to make the front end attractive and user-friendly as well as how to incorporate the Stripe payment system to accept payment for user subscriptions.
