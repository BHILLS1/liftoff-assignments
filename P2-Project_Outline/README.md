## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I have spent the last three years building a brand centered around yoga and wellness under my name, Brittany L Hill and the event experience I created, Back Trap Yoga. The app that I'm creating will be a proof of concept for a more in depth project to come that will answer the call for online clases from many clients and students of mine. This app will provide a subscription based platform that allow users to connect further by being able to experience my classes and alignment cues anywhere they can connect to the app. The app will have yoga flows (classes) available, yoga pose breakdown videos, and access to playlists for each class video as music is a key component to the yoga flows that I curate. This app gives students the opportunity to "take me anywhere" and participate in class if they've missed in person classes or live in another city. The app allows them to maintain consistency in their practice while being able to explore flows and poses at their own pace in the comfort of their own space.
### Features
User login: Users are able to log in and create an account. Each user will have an account page.
Accept payment: Users will be able to submit payment to initiate their subscription. Payment will auto-debit every month to maintain subscription.
Search: Users will be able to search through videos to find given text that describes specific pose or type of flow (i.e. "Downward Dog").
### Technologies
Java
JavaScript
SpringBoot
Stripe Payment
MySQL
SQLAlchemy
### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn JavaScript to make the front end attractive and user-friendly as well as how to incorporate the Stripe payment system to accept payment for user subscriptions.
